// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach(function (magician) {

// Call the make_great function to modify the magician names
var great_magicians = make_great(magician_names);
// Call the show_magicians function to see the modified list
