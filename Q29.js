// Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.
// • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!
// Array of favorite fruits
var favorite_fruits = ["Banana", "Grapes", "Mango"];
// Check if "banana" is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("Banana")) {
    console.log("You really like Bananas!");
}
// Check if "Grapes" is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("Grapes")) {
    console.log("You really like Grapes!");
}
// Check if "mango" is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("Mango")) {
    console.log("You really like mangoes!");
}
// Check if "orange" is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("Orange")) {
    console.log("You really like oranges!");
}
// Check if "strawberry" is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("Guava")) {
    console.log("You really like Guava!");
